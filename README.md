# Oceanography Final Project

This is our final project for EARS 3: Oceanography.

It's a dynamic user visualization of the oceans and currents using three.js.

All data courtesy of NASA.

Some of the visualization files could not be hosted on GitHub, as they are too large.  To allow all visualizations, download the video files from the mega.nz links, name them according to their paranthesized name, and save them in the "assets/videos/" folder.
