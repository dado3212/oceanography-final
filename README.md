# Oceanography Final Project

This is our final project for EARS 3: Oceanography.

It's a dynamic user visualization of the oceans and currents using three.js

One of the large problems was the tradeoff between performance and image quality.

With only the rotating Earth rendering, we get ~40 FPS.

With the 'Currents' visualization running at 2048x1024, it runs at ~8 FPS.

Running with the proper resolution of 4096x2048, it runs at ~4 FPS.
